            <h3 class="chapter-head">Concept behind the "Eat Hate" Series</h3>
            <p>On February 24, 2022, Russia began the invasion of Ukraine. At a point when it was believed that acts such as invasion and war would not happen again in the 21st century, the world got together in an instant and criticized Russia, and at the same time, people from all over the world took action to support Ukraine.<br>
                After a few months have passed and the situation has calmed down, I realize the absurdity of this conflict of the two polar opposites of justice and evil. Because the world is not that simple. Even issues that arise from micro relationships such as between friends, lovers, and family members cannot be easily classified as black or white.
                We don't understand anything. We always only begin to realize what something was all about long after it has happened. Even so, there is one thing that is certain. It is that the total amount of hatred in the world will inevitably increase, even if it was for just a quarrel. Skirmishes on the streets, quarreling between siblings quarrels and bickering, class struggles, racism, and war. Regardless of the scale of the problem, the human hatred that arises is essentially the same.<br>
                In this series, I attempt to reduce the hatred that is overflowing in this world. I ask the general public to write a message to someone they hate with chocolate syrup on a piece of bread, and then I will personally eat the bread in front of the writer of the message.<br>
                By physically erasing the hatred discharged by people, we produce a psychological catharsis. As proven by many scientific studies, writing your stress out on a piece of paper, rolling it into a ball and then discarding it actually reduces your negative emotions. Isn't it a small but steady and reliable peace movement that is more concrete than some abstract prayer?
