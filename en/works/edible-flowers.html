<p>
    In the 1789 French Revolution, the "The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen" was voted on and passed, but "man" in this declaration meant "male". It is said that women's protest against this is the origin of feminism. Since then, women's rights have improved, but they are still far from perfect.<br>
    In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of cases of harassment and other violent acts by men coming to light. While I do not wish to go into the details of each case, I would like to pay tribute to the women who have the courage to speak out without fear of prying eyes or slander.<br>
    This series uses store-bought edible flowers as a symbol of women. Mayonnaise and ketchup, which are made to look like semen and blood, are poured over the flowers and stirred. There are men who refer to sexual intercourse with women as "eating", and the fact that such expressions are still accepted rather than having become a dead language is proof that men's consciousness has not been updated yet. In fact, men have literally preyed on women, and continue to do so. As a man on the perpetrator's side, I would like to present this work as a tombstone of prehistoric masculine consciousness.
