				</dd>
				<dd>
					<p class="article">Gyudon is a typical fast food in Japan and shows us the three concepts of foods. In short, foods should be fast, cheap and tasty. It will be delivered to people super quickly and one can pour it into a throat in the twinkling of an eye. That action is colored with automation, task processing and eating it as a calorie. It is a dietary culture that means washing it down ; not tasting it ; not enjoying it. It was disappeared perfectly that the idea to eat is to live would give us the view of life or moral value. This fact eating machanically is not special thing in our developed countries of gluttony. But if you really think about it, don't you feel alarmed? These anxiety and posing a problem are depicted as Gyudon symbolically. And the image that it is falling both endlessly and disorderly to stomach of the public is expressed with the constract like the Streams of falling Gyudon. *Gyudon is a Japanese popular food consisting of a bowl of rice topped with beef and onion simmered in a mildly sweet sauce flavored with dashi, soy sauce and mirin.</p>
