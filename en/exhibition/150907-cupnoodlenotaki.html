								<h3 class="chapter-head">Solo exhibition "Cup Noodles Waterfall" statement</h3>
							<p>"Are you hungry?"<br>
					A cup noodle comical commercial film flew on tubes with such a catchphrase in 1992. It was 23 years ago and then I was 10. It was a primitive man was run after by a mammoth and made me fun but I didn't know and understand what that meant. Then 23 years passed. And I, who came to know a lot about various things including Are you hungry, will hold the private exhibition called "the waterfall of the cup noodle". I hang a picture scroll-formed more than 5m that I right described a cup noodle in like a waterfall from the ceiling of the colonnade and spread approximately 50, 000 disposable chopsticks all over the floor. The audience stands in there and people who soak headphones with a sound to slurp a cup noodle trailingly is endless and they look up at the waterfall of the cup noodle. It seems an answer to Are you hungry? In the people who were able to watch that commercial, ｗould there be the person who was really hungry? I don't think so. But cup noodles are keeping consumed and 30 billion meals exceeded in 80 countries. 50 billion? 100 billion meals? It's just a matter of time. And in that time will the world be fulfilled with happiness?</p>
